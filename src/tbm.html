				What are the Caryatid Sisters?
			</h2>
			<p>
				The Caryatid sisters are sculpted female figures that serve as architectural supports, traditionally used in place of columns. The term "Caryatid" comes from the Greek word "karyatides," which means "maidens of Karyai," referring to the women of the ancient Greek city of Karyai, renowned for their beauty.
			</p>
			<p>
				One of the most famous examples of Caryatids can be found at the Erechtheion, an ancient Greek temple on the Acropolis of Athens. The Erechtheion features a porch supported by six Caryatid figures, each intricately carved and with their own unique facial expressions and poses. These Caryatids are believed to represent priestesses or maidens serving as attendants to the temple.
			</p>
			<p>
				Today, five of the original six Caryatids remain in Athens, with one of them known as the "stolen" or "missing" Caryatid sister. This Caryatid was removed from the Erechtheion in the early 19th century by Lord Elgin

			<h2>
				Who called for their removal?
			</h2>
			<p>
				Thomas Bruce, 7th Earl of Elgin, was a British diplomat who served as the British ambassador to the Ottoman Empire, which controlled Greece at the time. During his time in Athens in the early 19th century, Lord Elgin obtained permission from Ottoman authorities to remove sculptures and other artifacts from the Parthenon and other ancient sites on the Acropolis.
			</p>
			<p>
				In 1801, workers under Elgin's supervision removed one of the Caryatids from the Erechtheion and transported it to England. The Caryatid was subsequently acquired by the British Museum, where it remains on display to this day.

			<h2>
				Why doesn't England give them back?
			</h2>
			<ol>
				<li>
					Ownership and Legalities: The British Museum, where the Caryatid is housed, legally acquired the sculpture in the early 19th century through the actions of Thomas Bruce, 7th Earl of Elgin. While there is debate over the ethics of Elgin's acquisition methods, the British Museum asserts its legal ownership of the Caryatid and the other Elgin Marbles.
				</li>
				<li>
					Cultural Heritage: Both Greece and England have strong arguments regarding the cultural significance of the Elgin Marbles. Greece argues that the sculptures are an integral part of their cultural heritage and should be returned to their place of origin. On the other hand, England argues that the Elgin Marbles have been part of the British Museum's collection for over two centuries and have become an important part of British cultural heritage as well.
				</li>
				<li>
					Preservation and Accessibility: The British Museum asserts that they have preserved the Elgin Marbles and made them accessible to a global audience for educational and cultural purposes. They argue that returning the sculptures to Greece could jeopardize their preservation and limit public access to them.
				</li>
				<li>
					Legal Precedent and International Relations: The issue of repatriating cultural artifacts is complex and involves legal, diplomatic, and political considerations. Returning the Caryatid to Greece could set a precedent for other restitution claims and raise questions about the ownership of cultural artifacts in museums worldwide. It could also impact diplomatic relations between the UK and Greece.
